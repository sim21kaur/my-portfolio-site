        description: "During my six-week study abroad in South Africa, I lived independently and fully immersed myself in the local culture. Visiting underprivileged communities gave me a profound new perspective and deepened my gratitude. Some of the highlights included experiencing an unforgettable safari, forging meaningful friendships, conquering a challenging mountain climb, and completing a rewarding internship with a small business. The entire experience was both eye-opening and empowering, leaving a lasting impact on me.",

The fresh local food is amazing, and the peaceful vibe makes it a perfect place to slow down and enjoy simple beauty. Can you tell I’m obsessed with cows?

I checked out Universal Studios, wandered through a beautiful garden filled with peacocks, and spent time at the zoo. I also visited Skid Row, one of the city’s poorer neighborhoods, which really showed me the stark contrast between wealth and hardship. Despite that, LA feels like a place full of opportunity, blending urban life, nature, and tons of activities in a unique way. The beaches, hiking trails, diverse food scene, and vibrant culture made it a dynamic and unforgettable trip.",

The island’s rich history, colorful streets, lively music, and delicious food made every moment special. From the beaches to the old towns, the warmth of the people and the culture really stuck with me.",
